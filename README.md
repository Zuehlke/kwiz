## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Starting the Backend
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
3. The backend will start on http://localhost:8080
4. Access the API documentation at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

### Starting the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies (first time only):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Angular development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. The frontend will be available at http://localhost:4200

The frontend is configured with a proxy to the backend, so API calls will be automatically forwarded to the backend server.

## API Documentation

The KwiZ application uses Swagger UI for API documentation. Swagger UI provides an interactive interface to explore and test the API endpoints.

### Accessing Swagger UI

1. Start the backend application as described in the "Starting the Backend" section
2. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

### Benefits of Swagger UI

- **Interactive Documentation**: Explore API endpoints with an interactive UI
- **Request Testing**: Test API requests directly from the browser
- **Response Visualization**: See the structure of API responses
- **Parameter Information**: Understand required and optional parameters for each endpoint

This is particularly useful for both backend and frontend developers to understand the available services and how to interact with them.
